# Table2

A complete rewrite of my QuickTable app, this time in React with ES2015+ and MongoDB.  Table2 enables a user to quickly create custom tables of generic data (grocery lists, books, movies, etc).  It is much faster than Google Sheets or embedded tables in Google Docs and works much better on mobile devices.
